## Developing

There's a few ways you can test. Since this is intended for Wallpaper Engine:
    
  -  Download as zip (Green 'clone or download' button above) 
  
  If using GIT;  inside terminal, pick a location to clone to
  
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/teachtyler/wallpaper-engine-web-template.git web-template
```
    
  - Inside wallpaper engine, choose a testing monitor, and click the Editor button at the top
  - Click, Create Wallpaper, and for some reason it'll ask for a folder.
     - find the directory where you downloaded/cloned this folder at
  - At the top right next to File, Click Edit and `Open in Explorer`
    - MAKE CHANGES TO THIS NEW FOLDER
    - Open up your text editor to this new location that should resemble '\wallpaper_engine\projects\myprojects\'
      - saving any changes made here will be reloaded automatically in the Wallpaper Editor
      - Changes made in the original folder will not be reflected
    
    
 ####  To test project.json changes: 

  - Go to File -> Apply as Wallpaper
  - Inside Wallpaper UI, it should appear as a new "Installed" wallpaper with the Settings updated.
